Content Rules
=============

Guardrails for clean slides. These are prompt rules enforced while
writing slide content, plus the validation that backs them up.

Titles
------

-   **Action titles**: every slide title states the takeaway, not the
    topic -- `"Revenue beats forecast by 12%"`, not
    `"Q3 results"`. Reading ONLY the titles, in order, must tell
    the deck's complete story.
-   **Unique titles**: no two slides share a title (titles are also
    the stable `title:` address for later edits).
-   **Title capacity**: the title placeholder has a budget too --
    `tpl describe` reports `~N lines of ~M chars` for it (a safety buffer
    is already subtracted). Keep the action title within it; a title that
    would wrap past its box triggers `W_TEXT_OVERFLOW`, so shorten it (or,
    if the message truly needs the length, pick a layout with a roomier
    title). Title layouts are often single-line -- watch the char budget.

Body
----

-   **One message per slide**: the slide's message is fixed as ONE
    sentence in the outline before any content is written. If it does
    not fit one sentence, split the slide.
-   **6x6 guideline**: at most ~6 bullets per slide, ~6-8 words per
    bullet, indent `level` at most 2. No prose paragraphs on slides --
    details go into the speaker notes.
-   **Capacity over instinct**: `pptc tpl describe` states per
    placeholder `~N lines of ~M chars`. Write text AGAINST that
    budget. Validation: `pptc apply ... --dry-run --strict` fails with
    `W_TEXT_OVERFLOW` (exit 7) on overflow -- then SHORTEN or SPLIT,
    never rely on PowerPoint auto-shrink.
-   **Consistent font sizes -- take them from the template, never invent.**
    `tpl inspect` reports each placeholder's `fontSizePt`. Use the BODY
    size for body/explanatory text and the FOOTER size (the small one) for
    source/link footnotes. Code keeps its one sidecar size; all tables
    share ONE size deckwide. Scattered ad-hoc sizes are visual noise --
    avoid size variation that has no reason.

Language and footer
-----------------

-   **Deck language**: fixed once in deck setup (ask when not obvious
    from the request), independent of the conversation language. ALL
    deck-facing text -- titles, bullets, notes, footer, AI note -- is
    written/translated into the deck language. Image prompts stay
    English.
-   **Footer on every slide**: the template's footer pattern (see
    template sidecar) with the actual deck title and the CURRENT year.
    Never ship the template's placeholder title (e.g. "Insert title") or
    a stale year; ask for the title when it cannot be derived.
-   **AI-image note**: every slide whose layout has picture
    placeholders carries a note that the images are AI-generated, in
    the deck language (de: "Bilder mit KI generiert", en: "Images
    AI-generated"), appended to the footer. Layouts without a footer
    placeholder (typically title/closing) get the note as a small
    discreet textbox near the bottom edge instead (`el.add`).

Elements (tables, charts, free shapes)
--------------------------------------

-   **Placeholders first.** Anything that is TEXT goes into a layout
    placeholder via `slide.fill` -- rich text covers fonts, sizes,
    colors, bullets and hyperlinks. Pick the layout whose placeholder
    fits the content (`tpl describe` capacities) instead of placing a
    textbox on a blank layout. `el.add` is ONLY for what placeholders
    cannot hold: tables, charts, shapes, images, connectors -- and the
    sanctioned overlays (prompt boxes, AI note where no footer
    placeholder exists). A code block is TEXT, NOT an exhibit.
-   **Code blocks / file trees are placeholder text, not `el.add`
    textboxes.** Put them in a content body placeholder (a
    title-plus-content layout) via `slide.fill`, with every run in the
    template's **code font** (from the template sidecar, e.g. a
    monospace family member) and **bullets turned off** (`bullet: false`),
    preserving leading spaces for indentation. Do NOT build a free
    textbox "code card" -- that bypasses the template. (A `ppt-prepare`
    plan may label such a slide layout type "code block"; that maps to a
    BODY PLACEHOLDER filled with the code font, not to `el.add`.)
-   Slides that receive free elements via `el.add` ALWAYS use a layout
    WITHOUT text placeholders in the content area (role "blank" --
    title plus empty surface). Elements must never sit on top of body
    placeholders; that layout role comes from the template sidecar or,
    failing that, the layout whose only placeholder is the title.
-   Position elements on the template's own grid: `tpl inspect`/`describe`
    report a **`contentArea`** (the body region snapped to the master's
    guides) and the raw `guides`. Place a full-width table at the
    `contentArea` frame; centre a narrower textbox/diagram within it. This
    aligns every element to the template instead of guessing coordinates.
-   **Stay inside the contentArea -- never cross the guides.** EVERY
    `el.add` element (table, SVG/native diagram, textbox) must lie FULLY
    within the `contentArea`: its top at or below `contentArea.y` (do NOT
    start in the title band above it), its bottom at or above
    `contentArea.y + h`, and its left/right within the side guides. When a
    slide stacks a table or diagram AND an explanation textbox, the two
    TOGETHER must fit inside the contentArea height -- shrink rows, font or
    text to fit; never let an element overflow the guides or the slide.
-   **Uniform tables.** Across the deck all tables share ONE look: header
    fill = the template's primary accent (`accent1`) with white text,
    single-line headers, a light `altRowBg`, a subtle `border`, and a
    FIXED `headerHeight`/`rowHeight` (table `style`) so header bands and
    row heights match on every slide.
-   **Never cover existing text fields** (placeholders incl. the
    footer/slide-number area, textboxes, tables, charts) with a new
    element -- prompt boxes are the only sanctioned overlay. pptc
    enforces this: `W_ELEMENT_OVERLAP` names the covered shape; under
    `--strict` the apply fails (exit 7). On a finding, REPOSITION the
    element, never ignore it.
-   **Element font sizes -- readable, few, never tiny.** The template
    scale ("take sizes from the template") only covers PLACEHOLDER text;
    free `el.add` elements (chips, cards, captions, diagram labels,
    annotations) have no template size, so DON'T invent tiny ones. A
    workable scale derived from a 16pt body / ~9pt footer template:
    **14pt** for card titles, central diagram labels and code; **12-13pt**
    for chips, card subtexts and annotations; **11pt** for captions,
    helper labels and hints. **11pt is the absolute floor** -- nothing
    smaller on a presented slide (Kawasaki: oldest audience age / 2; Duarte
    leans stricter at 12pt). Keep to **3-4 sizes per slide**; scattered
    ad-hoc sizes are visual noise. pptc enforces the floor: `W_FONT_TOO_SMALL`
    names any run/element below the minimum (default 11pt, tune with
    `--min-font-pt`, `0` disables); under `--strict` the apply fails (exit 7).
    Footer/slide-number/date placeholders and prompt boxes are exempt --
    footnote-scale text belongs in the footer placeholder, not a free 8pt
    textbox.

Self-explanatory slides (decks READ without a presenter)
--------------------------------------------------------

When the deck is self-study material -- read with no speaker to fill the
gaps (the briefing says so) -- every slide must stand on its own. A bare
exhibit (code, table, diagram, image) under a title is NOT enough.
(Assertion-Evidence, Alley; "slidedoc", Duarte; multimedia principles,
Mayer.)

-   **Assertion title + takeaway -- land a point.** The title is a
    full-sentence claim; the slide also carries a one-line plain-language
    **takeaway** -- the "so what / what this means for you" -- besides the
    exhibit. Every slide closes on a POINT: a conclusion (the Fazit /
    implication) or a pointed question ("wouldn't it be better if ...?").
    Showing the status quo alone is not a finished slide.
-   **Explain every exhibit, for a beginner:**
    -   *Code:* a lead-in sentence (what it shows) + highlight the key
        line + a one-line plain-language takeaway; keep <= ~15 lines.
    -   *Table:* a lead-in/takeaway sentence; gloss what the columns and
        entries MEAN for a beginner (units, plain words); highlight the
        key row/cell. Explanatory prose that does not fit a placeholder
        goes in a **textbox beside the table, in the template's body font
        and size** (sidecar) -- a sanctioned exception to "placeholders
        first" for explaining an `el.add` exhibit.
    -   *Diagram:* label parts NEXT TO them (spatial contiguity), never in
        a separate legend.
-   **Signal the point.** Bold/colour/highlight the ONE element that
    carries the message (key code line, key cell). One key point per slide.
-   **Sparse slide -> side-image layout.** If a slide carries little text
    (a few short bullets or one short statement), do NOT ship a near-empty
    full-width text slide: choose a TEMPLATE LAYOUT WITH A SIDE PICTURE
    placeholder (bullets + image) and a MEANINGFUL image -- or an
    infographic that proves the message -- never decoration. Accept a
    SHORTER assertion title when the side-image layout's title area is
    narrow; the image earning its half of the slide beats empty space.
    Reserve full-width text layouts for genuinely text-dense slides.
-   **Cite on the slide.** Put the source (a short `Source: <url>`) on the
    slide where the claim/data/quote appears; a references-only-at-the-end
    slide is not enough for a read-alone deck. One representative source
    per slide; the full list still closes the deck.
-   **Word budget.** Read-alone slides may carry more text than a live
    slide (~100-250 words, the slidedoc range) -- enough to be
    self-explanatory, but skimmable: visual hierarchy, bold keywords, one
    idea per slide.

Speaker notes
-------------

-   **Presented decks:** every content slide gets notes via the `notes`
    field: 40-70 words covering the core message, key numbers, and the
    transition to the next slide.
-   **Self-study / teaching decks SKIP notes** -- the slide is read without
    a presenter, so it must be self-contained; the explaining text belongs
    ON the slide, not in a notes pane no one opens.
-   Slides with charts/images additionally get 1-2 sentences
    describing the visual (doubles as accessibility text) -- on a self-study
    deck this description is on the slide, not in notes.

Structural slides
-----------------

-   **Agenda** derives from the chapter titles, one bullet each. When
    chapters are added/renamed/removed, update the agenda slide in the
    same ops document (`slide.fill` on the agenda slide).
-   **Chapter divider** carries the chapter title AND a one-line chapter
    **Fazit** as a subtitle (an advance organizer: what the chapter
    concludes), synthesized from the chapter's slides and their takeaways.
    Its image synthesizes the WHOLE chapter (see `prompt-formula.md`), not
    just the title.
-   **Chapter summary.** Each chapter ENDS with a "Key takeaways" slide:
    2-4 short bullets distilled from the chapter's slides (close on the
    chapter Fazit). This is segmenting + retrieval for self-study decks.
-   **Closing slide** carries a call-to-action, not a summary.
-   Business decks follow SCQA where it fits: situation, complication,
    question, answer -- recommendation early, not last.

- [ ] Footer carries the deck title and the current year on every slide
- [ ] AI-image note present on every slide with picture placeholders
- [ ] Self-study deck: each slide stands alone -- assertion title + a
      plain-language takeaway; no bare code/table/diagram exhibit
- [ ] Code/table/diagram explained for a beginner; key line/cell signalled
- [ ] A representative source/URL is cited on each slide that makes a
      claim or shows data (not only on the closing references slide)
- [ ] Sparse slides use a meaningful image/infographic, not empty space
